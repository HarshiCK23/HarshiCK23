## Hi there 👋

I'm Harshi, an Infomration Technology student majoring in cybersecurity based in Australia. 

I am currently re-learning python and I have found that I am quite interested in the language and want to learn more about it. 

Consistently writing down new projects to do and down below are my next three programming projects I wish to add to my github; 
 1. Task Tracker
 2. Password Manager
 3. PIG

(P.S. these change every week)

On the side, I am also taking a SOC Analyst L1 Certificate with TryHackMe to add to my credibility as a cybersecurity major. 

My main tech stack would be with SIEM, EDR and Threat Intelligence :) 

## Fun Facts 
  - I love huskies (and cats!)
  - Huge fan of coffee and tea
  - Favourite anime is Black Clover
  - Hobbies: Coding, Swimming, Reading, playing games (and building them)
